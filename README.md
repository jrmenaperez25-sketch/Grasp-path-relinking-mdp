# GRASP and GRASP + Path Relinking for the Maximum Diversity Problem

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure)** and **GRASP combined with Path Relinking** metaheuristics applied to the **Maximum Diversity Problem (MDP)**.

The implementation follows the methodology and experimental structure described in the accompanying article, focusing on solution construction, local improvement, elite set management, and path relinking strategies.

## Maximum Diversity Problem (MDP)

Given a set of elements and a distance matrix, the Maximum Diversity Problem consists of selecting a subset of fixed size such that the **sum of pairwise distances between selected elements is maximized**.

The MDP is a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard, which makes metaheuristic approaches such as GRASP particularly suitable.

## Implemented Metaheuristics

### GRASP

The GRASP implementation follows the standard two-phase structure:

1. **Construction Phase**
   - Greedy randomized selection of elements
   - Restricted Candidate List (RCL) controlled by parameter α

2. **Local Search Phase**
   - Iterative improvement of the constructed solution
   - Neighborhood exploration to increase solution quality

Each iteration produces a locally optimal solution, and the best solution across iterations is retained.

### GRASP + Path Relinking

The extended method enhances GRASP by incorporating **Path Relinking**:

- An **elite set** of high-quality solutions is maintained
- Pairs of elite solutions are selected as:
  - Initiating solution
  - Guiding solution
- Intermediate solutions are generated by gradually transforming one solution into the other
- The best solution found along the path is selected

This strategy intensifies the search by exploring promising regions of the solution space.

## Experimental Setup

The experiments are structured as follows:

- Two instance types:
  - Type I: n = 100, m = 10
  - Type II: n = 500, m = 50
- Multiple independent executions per instance
- Fixed GRASP parameters across experiments
- Comparative evaluation between GRASP and GRASP + Path Relinking
